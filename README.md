## Background
Autonomous driving involves complex decision-making in highly interactive environments, requiring thoughtful negotiation with other traffic participants.
While reinforcement learning provides a way to learn such interaction behavior, efficient learning critically depends on scalable state representations.
Contrary to imitation learning methods, high-dimensional state representations still constitute a major bottleneck for deep reinforcement learning methods in autonomous driving.
In this paper, we study the challenges of constructing bird's-eye-view representations for autonomous driving and propose a recurrent learning architecture for long-horizon driving. 
Our PPO-based approach, called RecurrDriveNet, is demonstrated on a simulated autonomous driving task in CARLA, where it outperforms traditional frame-stacking methods while only requiring one million experiences for efficient training. 
RecurrDriveNet causes less than one infraction per driven kilometer by interacting safely with other road users.

### Our Contribution
Current reinforcement learning approaches for learning driving policies face the bottleneck of dimensionality. In this paper, we evaluate the efficiency of various bird's-eye-view representations used for describing the state of the driving scene. In addition to that, we propose a novel LSTM-based encoding scheme for efficiently encoding the bird's-eye-view state representation across the full trajectory of states in a reinforcement learning fashion. This alleviates the need for old-fashioned frame-stacking methods and enables further long-horizon driving research.

### Results
Based on our chosen LSTM-based encoding of bird's-eye-view representations, we achieve significantly higher average returns while reducing the number of infractions when driving compared to frame-stacking methods. This allows also robust stopping at red traffic lights.
